        <h1>How to get fair skin and brighter face</h1>
        <h3>6 ESSENTIAL FAIR SKIN TIPS TO FLAUNT A BRIGHTER COMPLEXION</h3><br>
        <h1>1. Cleanse your system</h1>
        <p>Did you know? Detoxification is not just from the outside but from the inside too. A diet rich in antioxidants can do wonders in helping you get
            rid of all the chemical compounds that are damaging your body and in turn, your skin. Once your body is rid of these chemicals,
            your skin is bound to feel better and look brighter. Detoxifying your system from time-to-time is one of the best ways to flush out toxins
            that are harming your skin.<br>
            <br>
            To do this just mix magically honey and lemon in warm water and consume it every morning without fail.
            This detox water will help you achieve blemish-free, clear and bright skin.
            Another way of cleansing your system is hav* fresh aloe vera juice on an empty stomach.

        <h1>2. Follow an effective skin care regimen</h1>
        <p>It’s not just your system that needs to be cleansed. Your skin needs equal and thorough cleansing. Therefore,
            it’s important to follow a skin care regimen religiously. Firstly, make sure you have a set cleansing-toning-moisturising
            routine as it is essential in making your complexion clear and bright. However, it’s important that your skin care products
            suit your skin type, especially if you have oily skin. Oily skin is more prone to dirt and dust which makes the skin look darker than usual.<br>
            <br>
            Secondly, pamper your skin by exfoliating at least thrice a week. Washing your face is not enough.
            Exfoliating needs to be a part of your daily cleansing routine too.
            Scrubbing regularly helps remove dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin thereby revealing a healthy glow.
            If the top layer of dead skin cells stays put for too long,
            your complexion will not only appear dull and uneven but also feel rough or dry to touch.
            Another essential fair skin tip is to use sun protection before your skin is exposed to the harmful UV rays to prevent tan and uneven tone.
            We suggest you get your hands on the Lakmé Sun Expert Ultra Matte SPF 50 PA+++ Lotion Sunscreen which is lightweight
            and blocks up to 97 percent harmful rays.

        <h1>3. Use natural ingredients to purify your blood</h1>
        <p>A clean and healthy system will directly reflect on your skin. We suggest you take the natural route by including blood purifying foods
            and vegetables in your daily diet. Neem, bitter gourd and green leafy vegetables will help cleanse your stomach
            and at the same time purify your blood. Blend a few neem leaves with water and add a pinch of turmeric to the mixture.
            Consume a teaspoon of this paste on an empty stomach. Inculcating this habit every morning is sure to clear your
            system which in turn will reflect on your skin. Neem leaves have skin lightening properties which will help you reveal brighter,
            fairer complexion without the use of chemical products that may harm your skin.
        </p><br>

        <h1>4. Reduce any skin imperfections</h1>
        <p>Acne, pimples and acne scars leave a trail of pigmentation and uneven tone on their way out,
            thereby preventing you from achieving clear, glowing skin. Therefore,
            use nourishing face packs or creams that’ll help banish dark spots and blemishes instantly and reveal a fairer complexion.
            One of the most effective fair skin tips is to use a face cream which is enriched with vitamins and will give you instant
            fairness and glow such as the Fair & Lovely Advanced Multi Vitamin High Definition Glow Cream.
            Applying this cream regularly will help reduce suntan, lighten dark circles and skin tone and treat dullness. However,
            never commit the mistake of popping your pimples as that can leave marks behind.
            And refrain from exfoliating your skin when you have acne because doing so might just worsen the condition.
        </p><br>

        <h1>5. Eat. Drink. Exercise. Repeat</h1>
        <p>Making a few lifestyle changes can also help you achieve a brighter complexion. A healthy diet, for instance,
            can improve the complexion of your skin. Avoid oily, processed, junk food and load up on green leafy vegetables,
            fruits and lean meats. Secondly, drink enough water throughout the day.
            One of the most natural ways of improving your complexion is to drink lots of water. Thirdly,
            sweat it out. Exercising regularly removes the unnecessary toxins from your body thereby imparting a healthy glow to the skin.
            Include an hour of exercise in your lifestyle. It can be anything you love such as yoga, running or boxing.
            And lastly, never sleep with makeup on. Sleeping with your makeup can cost you big time.
            From clogging pores and showing early signs of ageing to making your skin look dull and uneven,
            sleeping with makeup on can wreak havoc on your skin. If you want brighter, fairer skin,
            then ensure you get rid of all the makeup before hitting the sheets.
        </p><br>

        <h1>6. Indulge in de-tan facials</h1>
        <p>Pampering your skin with facial treatments once a month can prove to be extremely beneficial for the health of your skin.
            Regular facials help polish skin, remove tan and protect skin from the harsh UV rays. Apart from that,
            a bleaching treatment done once in three months is one of the most effective fair skin tips.
            Bleaching will help cleanse your skin and improve your skin tone and complexion.
            It is an effective way to reduce the appearance of blemishes and dark patches, thereby lightening your skin tone.<br>
            <br>
            If you don’t have the time for luxury facial treatments at the parlour,
            then simply make a face pack at home using natural ingredients for brighter skin.
            Make a paste using gram flour, milk and a pinch of turmeric.
            Apply the paste all over your face and let it sit until it dries completely. Rinse off with cool water.
            This homemade face pack for fairer skin will leave you with a lighter skin tone instantly. Other ingredients such as lemon,
            fuller’s earth, cream, curd, tomatoes and cucumbers work well to lighten your skin tone. If dark spots,
            pigmentation or uneven tone is bringing your skin game down,
            then turn to natural remedies as they prove to be the healthiest fair skip tips that’ll do no harm to your skin.
