        <h1>Pink Lip</h1>
        <h3>14 Ways to Get Healthy-Looking Lips</h3><br>
        <h1>1. Exfoliate your lips </h1>
        <p>Before you head to bed at night, apply a good quality lip balm. After waking up,
            use a damp washcloth or a toothbrush to gently rub off any dead or dry skin. This will also boost circulation to the area.
        </p><br>

        <br>
        <h1>2. Try a homemade lip scrub</h1>
        <p>Using this recipe, you can exfoliate the thin skin on your lips with raw sugar while you lock in moisture with almond oil and honey.
            <br>
            Shop for almond oil and honey.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip2.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>3. Stay hydrated</h1>
        <p>One of the most common causes of dry skin is not drinking enough water.
            Getting eight glasses of water a day will benefit your body in lots of ways, and fuller-looking lips are an added benefit.
            <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip3.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>4. Check your medicine cabinet</h1>
        <p>Not all beauty products for lips are created equal. Lip balms that contain shea butter, cocoa butter,
            and coconut oil give your lips a natural barrier of protection from heat and pollution. But other ingredients,
            such as camphor, can dry out your lips. Make sure you also toss any expired products.<br>
            <br>
            Shop for lip balms with shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil.
        </p><br>

        <h1>5. Use vitamin E</h1>
        <p>If you have vitamin E capsules, you can simply cut one open and apply the product right to your lips.
            Vitamin E boosts circulation and may help generate new skin cells, making your lips softer
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip5.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>6. Moisturize with aloe vera</h1>
        <p>You can purchase pure aloe vera gel or even crack a leaf from an aloe plant in your home for this remedy.
            Aloe vera has soothing and healing properties, helping lips to look their best.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip6.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>7. Use a berry-based lip scrub </h1>
        <p>Strawberries are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which makes them a great ingredient for nourishing the skin on your lips.<br>
            <br>
            Crushing up a strawberry and adding it to a honey and olive oil mixture is the basic recipe for this home remedy.
            Feel free to experiment with antioxidant-packed blueberry variations as well.
        </p><br>

        <h1>8. Wake up lips with citrus </h1>
        <p>Using a few drops of lemon juice, you can make your lips appear brighter and slough off dead skin. Just rub the lemon juice on to your skin and watch your
            skin brighten up before your eyes. Make sure your lips aren’t cracked or super dry before you use this remedy, as it may sting and make things worse.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip8.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>9. Protect lips from the sun</h1>
        <p>Using daily SPF 15 or above, even on cloudy or cold days, helps slow the signs of aging.
            Your lips can become damaged by UV rays from sun exposure or even sunless tanning beds.<br>
            <br>
            Make sure you’re using a lip balm with an SPF ingredient. Reapplying sunscreen hourly to your lips will give you the best results.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip9.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>10. Use natural plant dyes</h1>
        <p>If you’re going after an even lip color that’s slightly more reddish than your skin tone, natural plant dyes are a good place to start. They also won’t irritate or dry out lips like heavy lipsticks.
            Raspberry juice or pomegranate juice applied directly to your lips can temporarily stain your lips a pinkish color.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip10.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>11. Limit exposure to toxins</h1>
        <p>Polluted air, smoke, and chemicals can prematurely age skin, making lips look dark or wrinkled.
            Habits like smoking can aggravate this effect and give your lip color a faded appearance.<br>
            <br>
            Avoiding cigarettes and secondhand smoke can improve the way your lips look. Wearing a scarf to cover lips may also protect them from overexposure.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip11.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>12. Take off your makeup before bed</h1>
        <p>Sleeping in your makeup isn’t good for your skin, and your lips are no exception.
            Even if there’s no visible lipstick or product on your lips at the end of the day,
            give them a gentle swipe with a makeup-removing wipe before you hit the pillow.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip12.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>13. Try peppermint oil to boost circulation</h1>
        <p>Using peppermint oil on your lips may boost circulation to the area. It also provides a cooling sensation that can soothe lips that feel dry.<br>
            <br>
            Mixing peppermint oil with a carrier oil, such as almond oil or coconut oil, makes for a luxurious DIY lip balm that you can reapply throughout the day.
        </p><br>
        <img class="img" src="{{ asset('image/lip13.jpg') }}"><br><br>

        <h1>14. Always prep before using lipstick</h1>
        <p>Even when you’re using lip color products that aim to minimize skin damage,
            it’s still a good idea to coat your lips with a primer to stop them from getting dried out before you put on lipstick.<br>
            <br>
            Use a cotton swab or lip brush to prime lips with coconut oil or almond oil. Let it fully soak in before you perfect your pout with a swipe of your favorite lip stain.
            <br><br>
            Similarly, when weather is chilly, remember to wear a pair of mittens or gloves so that the cold air and wind don't undo the hard work you did moisturizing,
            leaving you with dry, flaky, scaly skin.
