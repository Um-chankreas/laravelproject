        <h1>Everyday Health Diet & Nutrition</h1>
        <h3>11 Banana Health Benefits You Might Not Know About</h3><br>
        <h1>1. Superfood</h1>
        <p>Forget apples. A banana a day keeps the doctor away.

            Banana health benefits far outweigh those of the apple. That’s because they have many more vitamins and nutrients than their round counterparts.

            Bananas have twice as many carbohydrates, 5 times as much Vitamin A and iron, and 3 times as much phosphorus as apples. Bananas are also rich in potassium, fiber and natural sugars.

            The vitamin C, potassium and other vitamins and minerals bananas contain help to maintain overall good health.

            Because the fruit’s sugar content is balanced with fiber, it helps maintain a healthy blood glucose level. Even people with diabetes can enjoy a banana, according to the American Diabetes Association.

            This wealth of nutrients makes bananas a “superfood” that should be an integral part of your healthy daily regimen.

        <h1>2. Energy Booster</h1>
        <p>Bananas are a better source of energy than expensive sports drinks, according to a 2012 study at Appalachian State University, published in PLoS ONE.

            Two bananas provide enough calories for an 1-1/2 hour workout or walk.

            Bananas also are an ideal pick-me-up. When you feel tired and sluggish in the afternoon don’tgo for coffee or a sugary snack. Grab a banana instead.

            Your energy level will last longer, and you won’t suffer the dramatic crash caused by caffeine or cake.

        <h1>3. Better Heart Health</h1>
        <p>Because they are rich in potassium, bananas help the body’s circulatory system deliver oxygen to the brain.

            This also helps the body maintain a regular heartbeat, lower blood pressure and a proper balance of water in the body, according to the National Institutes of Health.

            Potassium-rich foods are also known to reduce the risk of strokes in older women, according to a 2014 study in the American Heart Association journal, Stroke.

        <h1>4. Natural Laxative</h1>
        <p>Eat bananas, and you might say goodbye to constipation.

            Well-ripened bananas have a type of fiber that helps to restore and maintain regular bowel functions. They are a natural source for improving the movement of waste through the bowels, according to a 2014 Chinese study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food.

            So eat ripe bananas twice a day.

        <h1>5. Put a Smile on Your Face</h1>
        <p>Bananas have a small amount of tryptophan, an amino acid that when combined with bananas’ natural vitamin B6, helps boost the production of serotonin, a “feel-good hormone.”

            This mood-regulating substance may help your mind and body relax so you feel happier.

            Or it may just be the bright yellow color and the smile shape of a banana that does the trick, according to nutritionist Joannie Dobbs, Ph.D, CNS, at the University of Hawaii.

        <h1>6. Banish PMS Pain</h1>
        <p>Don’t take pills to reduce your menstrual pains. Try bananas instead.

            Bananas have plenty of vitamin B6. Some studies suggest that B6 may reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), according to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)

        <h1>7. Fight Morning Sickness</h1>
        <p>Because of the calming properties associated with vitamin B6, bananas are often eaten by pregnant women to combat early-pregnancy morning sickness, says Richmond Hill, Canada, dietitian Anar Allidina

        <h1>8. Hangover Remedy</h1>
        <p>The natural ingredients in bananas and their ability to replenish the body’s vitamins make them an ideal way to reduce the effects of a hangover.

            Put a couple bananas in the blender with some plain yogurt and add some honey to sweeten the taste. The fruit tends to calm the stomach and the honey helps to restore the blood sugar levels to normal.

        <h1>9. Itch Relief</h1>
        <p>Don’t throw banana peels away if you have an itchy mosquito bite.

            Rubbing the inside of a banana peel reduces itching and swelling of insect bites, people report.

            The research isn’t conclusive, but what do you have to lose by trying it?

        <h1>10. Soothe Ulcers</h1>
        <p>Bananas help to increase mucus in the digestive tract, which can help heal or even prevent stomach ulcers, according to alternative health researcher and chiropractor David Williams, D.C.

            They help reduce the irritation of the digestive system by leaving a protective coating around the inner walls, making it a natural way to promote intestinal health as well.

            Since they help to neutralize acidity, they’re also a great way to get rid of heartburn. They act as a natural antacid and quickly soothe the burn.

        <h1>11. Treat Warts</h1>
        <p>Banana peels also heal plantar, flat or common warts.

            If you have a wart, tape a banana peel over it before going to bed, the University of Maryland Medical Center says.
